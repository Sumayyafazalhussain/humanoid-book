# h1 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Project Focus
- The project is exclusively focused on the `/book_source` Docusaurus application.
- All backend logic and development are considered out of scope and are paused.

### II. Content Standards
- All documentation and content MUST be created and managed within the `book_source/docs/` directory.
- Allowed file formats are Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`).
- The tone of all written content MUST be Professional, Engineering-focused, and Instructional.
- Every content chapter MUST follow a consistent structure:
  1.  **Introduction**: State the purpose and scope.
  2.  **Core Concepts**: Explain the main ideas and principles.
  3.  **Code Examples**: Provide practical, working examples.

### III. Docusaurus Configuration
- The documentation sidebar MUST be either auto-generated by Docusaurus or explicitly defined in the `sidebars.ts` configuration file.
- The project MUST use the standard Docusaurus "classic" preset.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project-level standards and principles. All development activity, code reviews, and architectural decisions must align with it. Amendments require a documented proposal and review.

**Version**: 0.2.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Set initial adoption date. | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-06
